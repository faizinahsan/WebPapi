Dear Mr. / Mrs. HappyFresh
I am Mochamad Faizin Ahsan, a 6th semester student from Padjadjaran University majoring in Informatics Engineering. In this 6th semester I was required to do an internship in a technology company. I know HappyFresh from vacancies available from several websites and i am very interested in this company internship especially in the position of Android Programmer and Backend Programmer.

I hope that this apprenticeship application can be considered and accepted in your company. If I want to know more about me, I am very willing to take the time to be interviewed. Thus I submit this letter for your attention, I thank you.

Best regards,
Mochamad Faizin Ahsan
